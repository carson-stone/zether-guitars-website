      <h3>Mission</h3>
      <p>
        Our mission is to create hand-made guitars that suit musicians from level 
        zero all the way to the top. We make them by hand from sustainable woods and 
        materials, and we professionally test each one before it's sold. To us, these
        aren't just guitars; they're pieces of art. <br /> We believe everybody should play
        an instrument, so we also aim to make music accessible and fun for people of all 
        ages, and especially children, with the help of our partners. That includes the 
        <a href="#">Nashville Music Foundaton</a> and <a href="#">Guitars for All in 
        Virginia.</a> Please visit those organizations' sites to learn more.

      <h3>Story</h3>
      <p>
        Founded in 2011 by guitar enthusiast, Henry Ellson, in his family's basement, 
        Zether has always been a passion project. With the dream of making a guitar that he 
        could share with the world, and inspired by the greats before him, Peter got to work. 
        Only three years later, Zether's flagship store opened up in Norfolk, VA. <br />
        He enlisted the help of his brother, Brad, and his former band member and 
        girlfriend Jasmine to help him build his company, knowing that he was doing something 
        special. Now, with six stores and over 20,000 guitars sold, Zether is past its infancy 
        but still growing strong. Feel free to contact the founder and Zether department heads 
        below to learn more about them and their journey.
